2. What is a Combined Honours programme?

Combined Honours degrees are degrees that are taken in two different subjects, resulting in an X and Y
degree title. If you are taking a Combined Honours programme, these will be the two subjects you applied
for. These are referred to as your Principal Subjects.

In a Combined Honours degree you must take at least 135 credits in each Principal Subject (270 credits in
total), accrued over all three levels of study, with at least 45 credits at each level of study (Levels 4, 5 and 6)
in each of two Principal Subjects (90 credits per year). The remaining available credits can be filled with
modules from these subjects or other subjects entirely.

As a Combined Honours student you can choose to study just one subject in your final year of study, taking a
minimum of 90 credits in this subject. This will result in an X with Y degree title.

3. Overview of the Programme

Combined Honours Computer Science is a programme for students with an interest in the application of
computing to a wide range of problems. Computer systems are now vital to business, government, science
and society, and there is much demand for graduates with the professional understanding and practical skills
to harness software and hardware technologies to solve real-world problems and develop the systems of the
future. Many of the recent advances in these areas can be attributed to developments in computing, and this
trend is likely to increase in speed and impact.

The programme explores the theoretical underpinnings of the discipline and places an emphasis on practical
computer programming and software development. Combined and Single Honours Computing programmes
have a common first semester and common entrance requirements. This retains flexibility of choice during
the first semester of the first year. There are no specific subject requirements for entry to our computing
programmes, and no previous experience of computing or computer programming is assumed. The
programmes do not involve an advanced level of mathematics, and any mathematical knowledge needed
beyond that taught at GCSE is taught as part of the modules included in the programmes.

4. Aims of the programme

The broad aims of the programme are to:

develop the intellectual, practical and additional transferable skills of the student such that they gain a
sound academic grounding in the discipline of Computer Science and an understanding of the
professional issues relevant to their future working lives.
include areas of teaching at the leading edge of the discipline, as informed by subject research,
discipline and industry trends and market requirements.
prepare you for further study or research, and for employment in industry, commerce or public service.

The range of opportunities for graduates with computing skills continues to expand. Many of our graduates
move into employment that is directly computing-related, for example as systems analysts, software
engineers and consultants, working in the same context as Single Honours Computer Science graduates
from elsewhere. In some cases, the breadth of a Single Honours Computer Science degree is an advantage;
in others the sector of employment is also related to another Combined Honours degree subject, which
enables our students to offer a unique blend of skills to potential employers. A number of graduates go on to
study for higher degrees in a wide range of subject areas, at Keele and elsewhere.

Further information about the Keele Graduate Attributes can be found here: http://www.keele.ac.uk/journey/

6. How is the programme taught?

Learning and teaching methods used on the programme vary according to the subject matter and level of
the module. They include the following:

Traditional lectures providing students with detailed notes, often supported by copies of lecture
slides in print or electronic form
Practical sessions in computer laboratories often supported by copies of laboratory instruction sheets
Web-based learning using the University's virtual learning environment (KLE)
Tutorials and directed reading on specific topics under the supervision of a member of academic staff
Group project sessions in which students develop a design for a software item to a level sufficient to
allow implementation to follow

Apart from these formal activities, students are also provided with regular opportunities to talk through
particular areas of difficulty, and any special learning needs they may have, with their Personal Tutors or
module lecturers on a one-to-one basis.

These learning and teaching methods enable students to achieve the learning outcomes of the programme
in a variety of ways. For example:

lectures allow students to gain a systematic knowledge and understanding of computer science
concepts and ideas and how to apply them to development of software and information systems;
web-based learning and directed reading allow students to develop their interest in computer science,
their ability to reflect on their own learning and to take responsibility for its development;
group sessions enable students to develop their written and oral communication skills;
practical sessions and group work encourage students to work both independently and in collaboration
with others as well as enabling them to solve problems in new or unfamiliar environments.

7. Teaching Staff

The Computer Science academic staff currently comprises Professors, Readers, Senior Lecturers, Lecturers
and Teaching Fellows, of whom a number are Associate Fellows, Fellows and Senior Fellows of the Higher
Education Academy. More information about the Computer Science staff is available
at http://www.keele.ac.uk/scm/staff/

The University will attempt to minimise changes to our core teaching teams, however, delivery of the
programme depends on having a sufficient number of staff with the relevant expertise to ensure that the
programme is taught to the appropriate academic standard.

Staff turnover, for example where key members of staff leave, fall ill or go on research leave, may result in
changes to the programme's content. The University will endeavour to ensure that any impact on students is
limited if such changes occur.

8. What is the structure of the Programme?

The academic year runs from September to June and is divided into two semesters. The number of weeks of
teaching will vary from programme to programme, but you can generally expect to attend scheduled
teaching sessions between the end of September and mid-December, and from mid-January to the end of
April. Our degree courses are organised into modules. Each module is usually a self-contained unit of study
and each is usually assessed separately with the award of credits on the basis of 1 credit = 10 hours of
student effort. An outline of the structure of the programme is provided in the tables below.

There are three types of module delivered as part of your programme. They are:

4

Compulsory modules - a module that you are required to study on this course;
Optional modules - these allow you some limited choice of what to study from a list of modules;
Elective modules - a free choice of modules that count towards the overall credit requirement but not
the number of subject-related credits.

A summary of the credit requirements per year is as follows, with a minimum of 90 subject credits
(compulsory plus optional) required for each year across both of your Principal Subjects, with at least 60
credits at each level of study (Levels 4, 5 and 6). This document has information about Computer Science
modules only; please also see the document for your other subject.

10. How is the Programme Assessed?

The wide variety of assessment methods used on this programme at Keele reflects the broad range of
knowledge and skills that are developed as you progress through the degree programme. Teaching staff pay
particular attention to specifying clear assessment criteria and providing timely, regular and constructive
feedback that helps to clarify things you did not understand and helps you to improve your performance. The
following list is representative of the variety of assessment methods used on your programme:

Unseen examinations in different formats test a student's knowledge and understanding of computer
science topics. Such examinations are of two hours in length and contain compulsory and possibly also
optional questions

7

Class tests are taken during the course of a module, usually in a lecture slot. They are intended to
assess a student's current understanding and subject knowledge in that module in a structured and
focused manner. Some taught compulsory modules may have class tests as part of the assessment
profile
Coursework normally consists of assignments designed to assess student's knowledge and
understanding of the module material. Some of these assignments may be computer based; others take
the form of individual reports, essays or group projects
Short reports: for which students are required to write up their own account of small group studies
and discussions on particular topics
Tutorial Participation, whereby students may be asked to make contributions based on the subject
material, either orally or as a written solution, sometimes in consultation with their peers
Dissertations are formal reports of work carried out by students undertaking a project. Projects
involve the integration and application of theoretical knowledge and problem-solving skills to an
identified programming need and/or research problem within the discipline. Dissertations describe
product and process in extended detail
Oral presentations and reports  assess a student's ability to communicate their knowledge and
understanding, both visually and orally, to both general and academic audiences

Marks are awarded for summative assessments designed to assess your achievement of learning outcomes.
You will also be assessed formatively to enable you to monitor your own progress and to assist staff in
identifying and addressing any specific learning needs. Feedback, including guidance on how you can
improve the quality of your work, is also provided on all summative assessments within three working weeks
of submission, unless there are compelling circumstances that make this impossible, and more informally in
the course of tutorial and seminar discussions.

11. Contact Time and Expected Workload

This contact time measure is intended to provide you with an indication of the type of activity you are likely
to undertake during this programme. The data is compiled based on module choices and learning patterns of
students on similar programmes in previous years. Every effort is made to ensure this data is a realistic
representation of what you are likely to experience, but changes to programmes, teaching methods and
assessment methods mean this data is representative and not specific.

Undergraduate courses at Keele contain an element of module choice; therefore, individual students will
experience a different mix of contact time and assessment types dependent upon their own individual choice
of modules. The figures below are an example of activities that a student may expect on your chosen course
by year stage of study. Contact time includes scheduled activities such as: lecture, seminar, tutorial, project
supervision, demonstration, practical classes and labs, supervised time in labs/workshop, fieldwork and
external visits. The figures are based on 1,200 hours of student effort each year for full-time students.

14. Other Learning Opportunities

Study abroad (semester)

Students on the programme have the potential opportunity to spend a semester abroad in their second year
studying at one of Keele's international partner universities.

Exactly which countries are available depends on the student's choice of degree subjects. An indicative list of
countries is on the website (http://www.keele.ac.uk/studyabroad/partneruniversities/); however this does not
guarantee the availability of study in a specific country as this is subject to the University's application
process for studying abroad.

No additional tuition fees are payable for a single semester studying abroad but students do have to bear the
costs of travelling to and from their destination university, accommodation, food and personal costs.
Depending on the destination they are studying at additional costs may include visas, study permits,
residence permits, and compulsory health checks. Students should expect the total costs of studying abroad
to be greater than if they study in the UK, information is made available from the Global Education Team
throughout the process, as costs will vary depending on destination.

Whilst students are studying abroad any Student Finance eligibility will continue, where applicable students
may be eligible for specific travel or disability grants. Students who meet external eligibility criteria may be
eligible for grants as part of this programme. Students studying outside of this programme may be eligible
for income dependent bursaries at Keele. Students travel on a comprehensive Keele University insurance
plan, for which there are currently no additional charges. Some governments and/or universities require
additional compulsory health coverage plans; costs for this will be advised during the application process.

Study Abroad (International Year)

A summary of the International Year, which is a potential option for students after completion of year 2
(Level 5), is provided in the Annex for the International Year.

Work Placement Year

A summary of the Work Placement Year, which is a potential option for students after completion of year 2
(Level 5), is provided in the Annex for the Work Placement Year.

15. Additional Costs

Some travel costs may be incurred if an external project is undertaken in the third year. However, any such
costs would be discussed with you before the project was selected. It would be possible for you to select an
internal project that would not incur any additional travel costs.

These costs have been forecast by the University as accurately as possible but may be subject to change as
a result of factors outside of our control (for example, increase in costs for external services). Forecast costs
are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure they remain representative. Where additional costs are in direct
control of the University we will ensure increases do not exceed 5%.

As to be expected there will be additional costs for inter-library loans and potential overdue library fines,
print and graduation. We do not anticipate any further costs for this programme.

16. Annex - International Year

Computer Science with International Year

Please note: in order to be eligible to take the International Year option your other subject must also offer
this option. Please refer to the information published in the course document for your other subject.

International Year Programme

Please note that students on Combined Honours programmes with International Year must meet the
subject-specific learning outcomes for BOTH their principal subjects.

These learning outcomes will all be assessed by the submission of a satisfactory individual learning
agreement, the successful completion of assessments at the partner institution and the submission of the
reflective portfolio element of the international year module.

Course Regulations

Students registered for the International Year are subject to the programme-specific regulations (if any)
and the University regulations. In addition, during the International Year, the following regulations will
apply:

Students undertaking the International Year must complete 120 credits, which must comprise at least 40%
in the student's discipline area.

This may impact on your choice of modules to study, for example you will have to choose certain modules
to ensure you have the discipline specific credits required.

Students are barred from studying any module with significant overlap to the Level 6 modules to be studied
on their return. Significant overlap with Level 5 modules previously studied should also be avoided.

Additional costs for the International Year

Tuition fees for students on the International Year will be charged at 15% of the annual tuition fees for that
year of study, as set out in Section 1. The International Year can be included in your Student Finance
allocation, to find out more about your personal eligibility see: www.gov.uk

Students will have to bear the costs of travelling to and from their destination university, accommodation,
food and personal costs. Depending on the destination they are studying at additional costs may include
visas, study permits, residence permits, and compulsory health checks. Students should expect the total
costs of studying abroad be greater than if they study in the UK, information is made available from the
Global Education Team throughout the process, as costs will vary depending on destination.

Students who meet external eligibility criteria may be eligible for grants as part of this programme.
Students studying outside of this programme may be eligible income dependent bursaries at Keele.

Students travel on a comprehensive Keele University insurance plan, for which there are currently no

Work Placement Year Programme Aims

In addition to the programme aims specified in the main body of this document, the Work Placement Year
aims to provide students with the opportunity to carry out a long-term work-based learning experience
(minimum 30 weeks equivalent of full-time work) in the computing sector between Years 2 and 3 (Levels 5
and 6) of their degree programme. The module will be underpinned by employability skills training (as part
of their preparation during year 2), reflective assessment, employer and tutor evaluation and support from
academic tutors.

Entry Requirements for the Work Placement Year

All students undertaking the work placement degree programme will be provided with an academic tutor,
based at Keele. Students are expected to arrange their own work placement. A list of potential placements
will be provided that students can apply for, with allocation being based on a competitive interview process
involving the placement providers. Students are also permitted to provide their own placement option.
Support will be offered throughout the placement process. This will involve support ensuring the
appropriateness of the placement prior to starting the Placement Year, and email/telephone/face-to-face
contact with the academic tutor.

Students have the opportunity to apply directly for the 4-year 'with work placement year' degree
programme, or to transfer onto the 4-year programme at the end of Year-1 and in Year-2 at the end of
Semester 1. Students who are initially registered for the 4-year degree programme may transfer onto the
3-year degree programme at any point in time, prior to undertaking the year-long work placement.
Students who fail to pass the work placement year, and those who fail to meet the minimum requirements
of the work placement year module (minimum 30 weeks full time (1,050 hours), or equivalent, work
placement), will be automatically transferred onto the 3-year degree programme.

The criteria to be applied are:

A good University attendance record and be in 'good academic standing'.
Passed all Year-1 and Year-2 Semester 1 modules with an overall module average of > 55%
Students undertaking work placements will be expected to complete a Health and Safety checklist
prior to commencing their work experience and will be required to satisfy the Health and Safety
regulations of the company or organisation at which they are based.
(International students only) Due to visa requirements, it is not possible for international students who
require a Tier 4 Visa to apply for direct entry onto the 4-year with Work Placement Year degree
programme.  Students wishing to transfer onto this programme should discuss this with student
support, the academic tutor for the work placement year, and the Programme Lead.  Students should
be aware that there are visa implications for this transfer, and it is the student's responsibility to
complete any and all necessary processes to be eligible for this programme.  There may be additional
costs, including applying for a new Visa from outside of the UK for international students associated
with a transfer to the work placement programme.

Students may not register for both an International Year and a Work Placement Year.

Student Support

12

Students will be supported whilst on the Work Placement Year via the following methods:

Regular contact between the student and a named member of staff who will be assigned to the
student as their University supervisor. The University supervisor will be in regular contact with the
student throughout the year, and be on hand to provide advice (pastoral or academic) and liaise with
the Placement supervisor on the student's behalf if required.
Two formal contacts with the student during the placement year: the University supervisor will visit
the student in their placement organization at around the 5 weeks afters placement has commenced,
and then visit again (or conduct a telephone/video call tutorial) at around 15 weeks into the
placement.
Weekly supervision sessions will take place with the placement supervisor (or his/her nominee)
throughout the duration of the placement.

Learning Outcomes

In addition to the learning outcomes specified in the main text of the Programme Specification, students
who complete the 'with Work Placement Year' option will be able to:

LO4.1     Evaluate their own employability skills (via a SWOT Analysis).

LO4.2     Create ILOs for their placement in order to develop the skills areas which they have identified as
being weak or needing further enhancement.

LO4.3     Develop, through practice in the work place, the work-related skills identified through their SWOT
analysis and ILOs.

LO4.4     Apply academic theory learnt as part of the taught degree to real situations in the work place.

LO4.5     Reflect on their work placement activities and experiences and evaluate the impact on their
employability skills.

LO4.6     Explain how the professional computing sector operates and identify the skills required to pursue
careers within the sector.

These learning outcomes will be assessed through the non-credit bearing Work Placement Year module
(CSC-30024) which is assessed by a Mid-Placement Portfolio, a Final Placement Portfolio and an Oral
Presentation.

Regulations

Students registered for the 'with Work Placement Year' option are subject to programme-specific
regulations (if any) and the University regulations. In addition, during the Work Placement Year, the
following regulations will apply:

Students undertaking the Work Placement Year must successfully complete the zero-credit rated
'Work Placement Year' module (CSC-30024)
In order to ensure a high quality placement experience, each placement agency will sign up to a
placement contract (analogous to a service level agreement).
Once a student has been accepted by a placement organisation, the student will make a pre-
placement visit and a member of staff identified within the placement contract will be assigned as the
placement supervisor. The placement supervisor will be responsible for ensuring that the placement
experience meets the agreed contract agreed with the University.
The placement student will also sign up an agreement outlining his/her responsibilities in relation to
the requirements of each organisation.

Students will be expected to behave professionally in terms of: 

(i) conforming to the work practices of the organisation;  and 

(ii) remembering that they are representatives of the University and their actions will reflect on the School
and have an impact on that organisation's willingness (or otherwise) to remain engaged with the
placement. 

Additional costs for the Work Placement Year

13

Tuition fees for students on the Work Placement Year will be charged at 20% of the annual tuition fees for
that year of study, as set out in Section 1. The Work Placement Year can be included in your Student
Finance allocation; to find out more about your personal eligibility see: www.gov.uk

Students will have to bear the costs of travelling to and from their placement provider, accommodation,
food and personal costs. Depending on the placement provider additional costs may include parking
permits, travel and transport, suitable clothing, DBS checks, and compulsory health checks.

A small stipend may be available to students from the placement provider during the placement but this
will need to be explored on a placement-by-placement basis as some organisations, such as charities, may
not have any extra money available. Students should budget with the assumption that their placement will
be unpaid.

Eligibility for student finance will depend on the type of placement and whether it is paid or not. If it is paid,
this is likely to affect student finance eligibility, however if it is voluntary and therefore unpaid, should not
affect student finance eligibility. Students are required to confirm eligibility with their student finance
provider.

International students who require a Tier 4 visa should check with the Immigration Compliance team prior
to commencing any type of paid placement to ensure that they are not contravening their visa
requirements.

The University's Academic Regulations which can be found on the Keele University website
(https://www.keele.ac.uk/regulations/)[1] apply to and regulate the programme, other than in instances
where the specific programme regulations listed below over-ride them. These programme regulations list:

Exemptions which are characterised by the omission of the relevant regulation.
Variations which are characterised by the replacement of part of the regulation with alternative
wording.
Additional Requirements which set out what additional rules that apply to students in relation to this
programme.

The following exemptions, variations and additional requirements to the University regulations have
been checked by Academic Services and have been approved by the Faculty Education Committee.

A) EXEMPTIONS

The clause(s) listed below describe where an exemption from the University's Academic Regulations exists:

For the whole duration of their studies, students on this Programme are exempt from the following
regulations:

No exemptions apply.

B) VARIATIONS

The clause(s) listed below describe where a variation from the University's Academic Regulations exists:

Variation 1: Transfer onto the MComp Programme

This programme varies from Regulation C6, 2.3:

Regulation C6, paragraph 2.3 states that the rules governing eligibility for transfer onto an Integrated
Masters programme shall be governed by the relevant Course Regulations.

Combined Honours BSc Computer Science students will, subject to the same considerations, normally be
permitted to transfer on to the MComp Programme within two weeks of the commencement of Level 5.

Additional Requirements

The programme requirements listed below are in addition to the University's Academic Regulations:

Additional requirement 1: Study Abroad (semester abroad)

Students intending to study abroad must pass all modules in their first year and obtain an average of at least
50%.  The School can insist that no placement is made if a student's progress is not of a satisfactory
standard.

Students spending a semester abroad during their second year of study must agree a programme with the
Study Abroad Tutor (SAT) before they leave and must agree any subsequent changes that become
necessary.

Marks obtained will be converted into Keele equivalents according to the agreement between Keele and the
partner institution. In the case of borderline marks or incomplete work, the Computer Science examination
board will determine the mark to be awarded.  In the event of unfinished modules, the Director of Learning
and Teaching or Study Abroad Tutor may require extra work to be completed.
